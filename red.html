<br><h1>Red is the color of passion, anger, and urgency.</h1>
<p>The color red is seen as a very bold yet impulsive color, while also being seen as a color of luxury. 
It being seen as bold is the reason it is a color of passion because passion is bold. 
Red being seen as impulsive is the reason it is the color of urgency and angry because impulsiveness is highly associated with urgency and when the mind sees the impulsiveness of red it tend to trigger the sensory nerve that has to do with anger. 
This means that people who surround themselves with alot red tend to be more aggressive people. 
How red is perceive depends heavily on shade. 
The more bright vibrant shades tend to show excitement, for its boldness is like energy itself, but it also tends to show emergency because its brightness displays the urgency of the color. When it comes to bright red on web pages its better to use it sparingly. 
Small amount of bright red on a website is good for attention grabing, but done in large amounts can cause sensory overload and can make the website seem like to much. 
Dark red, however, is different it is the less urgent shade of red that while also being bold makes it perfect for making a sight feel luxury and nice to look at, but like bright red can be alot if not managed properly.</p>

<p>Just like how red can affect the overall feel of a website it can affect people too. 
People with the favorite color red tend to be like the color red. They are energitic, spontaneous, and in most cases aggressive poeple. 
This doesn't neccessarily mean their violent it just means they do everything in a more up front almost forceful manner that makes them out as agrressive. 
A color can not determine how ones personality maybe, but people tend to be draw to things that share their wave length. 
This means in most cases they will have a perosnality type that is like their favorite color because the color matched their wave length and that made it appealing to their brain.<br></p>

<p>People who do not like red are usually poeple who have a hard time with stress and find it hard to deal with the emotion anger. 
This means your brain rejects red because it represents everything your brain has a hard time handling.</p>
